====================================================================
Quantum Enganglemnt Simulation Based on Geant4 Polarization Modeling
====================================================================

	
 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
      The geometry consists of two LaBr detectors, six NaI detectors, 
      one lead box, and one Aluminium chip. six NaI detectors are 
      wrapped by lead.

      The gemometry dimensions are from the lab set up.
 	
 2- PHYSICS LIST
 
      polarized EM physics has been slected.
 	 
 3- EVENT GENERATOR
 
      The radicative source is located in the center of lead box. 
      positronium is used to simulate the two gamma ray decay. The initial 
      energy are set to 0 Mev. The gamma ray momentum direction are set to
      (0, 0, 1), and the polarization direction is set to the cross product
      of (0, 0, 1) X (0, 1, 0). 
 	
 4- PHYSICS
 
      This simulatiion uses the physics processes of polarized Compton 
      scattering, multiple scattering (unwanted), and polarized positronium 
      annihilation.

 5- DATA COLLECTION
         
      The energy which deposited on NaI detectors are out to .txt files.
 	 				
 6- VISUALIZATION

      To visulize the geometry setup, the default tool is used.
      For educational purpose, this simulation has chosen spreadsheet as
      a tool to visulize the distribution of energy deposited on detectors.
      The beta values and anisotropy can be calculated by spreadsheet tools.

      User can watch the process of gamma ray and other particles. Also,
      user can manully set the gates to see how the distribution is modified.
      User can calculate and graphy the derivations of beta values and 
      anisotropy. At the same tiem, the chart can be generated.

 7- RUN THE SIMULATION
 
      PreInit> /control/execute vis.mac 
      will display the geometry setup and default gamma ray processes.

      /run/beamOn 100
      will animate the 100 processes of gamma ray pathes and some scatterings.

      pol01 testrun.mac
      will generate 3-fold and 4-fold energy deposit data. The data will be 
      output to corresponding .txt files.

 8- DATA ANALYSIS

      Copy .txt files and paste it to spreadsheet. 

      Select the LaBr2 column and one NaI column, select Insert to insert a
      scatter plot chart. The distribution of energy depoisted on detector 
      will be displayed.
      
      Use =if(cell.value = 0, 0, 1) formula and to predfined gates to filter 
      out invalid data, and at the same time, a new grid which contian only 
      valid data will be created. 

      Use spreadsheet and beta and anieotrophy equations to calculate the 
      corresponding values. And then use Insert to make a chart. After select
      dots on chart, Select Add Trendline to generate the bell curve.

      This bell curve is the final result of this simulation.

 9- BEHIND THE SCENCE

      In order to simulate the lab process, there are three adjustments used
      to match the lab results. The first adjustment is for detector efficiency.
      The Gaussian distrubution is applied to data to simulate the physical
      effect of dector. Due to the solid angle between radioactive source and
      surface of detector, the energy deposited are not same on the center and 
      on the edge of detector. The second adjustment is to minimize the bias of
      orientation of detectors. Due to the Monte-Carlo simulation use statistic 
      distribution to reflect nature process, it takes a long time to stable its
      output. Rotated detector setup has been used during this research. 
      The third adjustment is on polarization data collection. Based on the lab 
      results and theory, most of energy will be deposited on the detectors 
      which are loacted on the polarized direction. This simulation uses the 
      data from the detectors on the strong polarized direction as output.  

 10- FUTURE IMPROVEMENT

      Improve the code on detector efficiency by incorperate the solid angle
      into detector. 
      Speed up the event  generation by adopting modified Monte-Carlo method.
      Modify the PhysicsList to make positronium annihilation more realistic.
